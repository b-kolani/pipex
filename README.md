# Pipex - 42 School Project
## Overview
  Pipex is a C programming project from the 42 School curriculum. It simulates the behavior of shell pipes (|) by redirecting input from a file through multiple commands and writing the final output to another file. This project focuses on mastering UNIX system calls like pipe(), fork(), dup2(), and execve().
  The program takes four arguments:
    - infile: The input file.
    - cmd1: The first command.
    - cmd2: The second command.
    - outfile: The output file.
